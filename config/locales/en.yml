    title: "History of Medavy Castle"
    timeline_title: "More than 400 years of History"
    origins: "The origins"
    origins_date: "Before 1704"
    origins_subtitle: ""
    origins_paragraph_html: "Located midway along the road connecting Argentan to Sées, Médavy has been since the XII century one of the duchy of Normandie’s major strongholds. As the fortress was probably destroyed between 1417 and 1449 during the invasion of the French kingdom by the English army, very little information is available on this first fortress."
    rouxel: "the Rouxel family."
    rouxel_date: "1704-1725"
    rouxel_subtitle: "The constitution of the domain from the XV century and the construction of the current castle"
    rouxel_paragraph_html: "Soon after the Hundred Years’ War, the Rouxel family acquired the property. It will remain in their possesion for two hundred and fitfty years (up to 1730). A first castle is built and the domain is expanded with the acquisition of neighbouring land.</br> </br> The family’s wealth grows after Pierre Rouxel’s rallying to the king Henri IV: Pierre Rouxel is appointed baron in 1596 and becomes governor of Argentan, office which will remain in the family up to 1725. The Orne river is then diverted in order to supply the moats with water, which causes the uplifting of the ground of the new castle by 1.5 – 2 m compared to the old one. Four towers are built on the four corners formed by the moats; only two remain today: the tower Saint Jean and the tower Saint Pierre.</br> </br> At the end of the XVII century, the Château de Médavy will momentarily be forsaken by the Rouxel family in favour of their other cradle, the Château de Grancey in Burgundy.</br> </br> Many members of the Rouxel family will make a name for themselves in combats, and two of them will be appointed marshals of France: Jacques Rouxel in 1651 and his grandson Jacques-Leonor Rouxel in 1724 to whom we owe most of the current castle which he decided to build between 1704 and 1725, the year of his death. It is a classical style construction of the beginning of the XVIII century, strongly inspired of Mansart (Versailles’architect)."
    montregard: "The Monregard Family."
    montregard_date: "1754-1820"
    montregard_paragraph_html: "The castle goes from one private owner to another until it is acquired in 1754 by Pierre Thiroux de Monregard, one of the king’s superintendents of the French relays and postal service, then head valet of the King Louis XVI in 1789. It was during this period that the stairway, the dovecote and the outbuildings (near the stud farm) were built. Moreover, in 1769, the Médavy estate is turned into an earldom. </br> </br> The 1789 Revolution causes the exil of the Monregard family: Pierre Thiroux de Monregard dies abroad in 1792, the furniture is dispersed in 1794, and the château stays uninhabited for ten years. In order to reconstitute his father’s domain, Charles Thiroux de Monregard incurs serious debts. He pulls down everything left of the old castle except for the kitchen and the towers. The castle will finally be sold in 1812 under the creditors’ pressure. It will remain uninhabited until 1820."

    laroque_paragraph_html: "Madame de la Roque acquires the château in 1820, rehabilitates it and lives in it all year until the end of her life in 1855. </br> </br> The castle is rehabilitated again in 1867 by the countess de Maussion, an indirect heiress of Madame Laroque. When she dies in 1896, the domain of Médavy covers a total area of 325 hectares.</br> </br> The heirs of Jean de Maussion, the countess’ son, sell Médavy in 1919 to Henri de Peyerimhoff de Fontenelle, an industrialist, the chairman of the Central Committee of French coal mines, and a member of the institute de France."

    recent_subtitle: "Peyerimhoff, de Grancey and de Rey's families"
    recent_paragraph_html: "Monsieur de Peyerimhoff will live periodically with his family in Médavy. The castle will be miraculously spared by the bombings during the landing battles in 1944. Monsieur de Peyerimhoff died in 1953 and his heirs put the property up for auction and sold it in several plots.</br> </br> The castle is then bought by the General de Grancey, military governor of the Invalides in Paris, who turns it into a holiday home for his family. Passionate about the Rouxel family’s history, the General de Grancey gathers a great amount of objects and documents concerning the second Marshal de Grancey and his family in the castle."
